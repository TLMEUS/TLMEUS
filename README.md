Greetings. My name is Troy Marker. I am the founder and primary developer at Troy L Marker Enterprises. I have been working on computer software for most of my life. I am also a huge fan of Gene Roddenberry's Star Trek,
and have tried to identify my software using a method similar to how Star Trek has named their Star  Fleet ships. Each piece of software I have created, and host here at GitHub is named similarily to how starships are
named.

Software titles contain a group of 2-4 letters followed by 2-4 numbers the represent the software title identify. The letters represent the type of software, and the numbers repsersent the serial number of the software.

The letters definitions are listed here:

AX - Application-Experimental

TCP - TLME Core Program

PHM - Phoenix Hospitality Management
