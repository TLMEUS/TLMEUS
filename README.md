## Greetings and Welcome

Greetings. My name is Troy Marker. I am the founder and primary developer at Troy L Marker Enterprises.

I have been working on computer software for most of my life. I started my programming journey nearly 40 years ago when 
I was a freshman in high school on a Texas Instruments TI-99/4A personnel computer my parents bought for the "family" 
for Christmas that year. I started with simple programs out of computer magazines. Over the years I moved up to Color
Computers from Radio Shack, all the while learning to write programs in the BASIC programming language. I then took a
correspondence course in computer programming, where I was introduced to the IDM compatible computer. 

This correspondence course introduced me to other languages, such as Pascal, C, C++, COBOL, and (my least favorite)
Assembly Language. I also created a simple program that resembled a Windows type program, before Windows was a thing.
If I had a little more ambition back then, I may have created my own fortune way back then. Well, maybe not, but it is
nice to dream.

Over the years I created my own little "offices" in different rooms in the family home, and continued to learn other
programming languages.

I do honestly have a love for programming, and find it to be challenging and do find joy creating a program to perform
a tack.

I am currently working on project in HTML, Swift, Java, and Kotlin. I am working on a project to assist at my "real"
job. It is my hope to get it approved by my employer to assist others at work. I am alway willing to talk about my
projects, and assist anyone I can with any programming problems that I can. You may email me at ceo@tlme.us anytime
if you want to chat.

Thank you for reading.

Troy L. Marker
